New DG Food Agro is a multinational exporter of various grains from India for nearly 130 years but their main product of exporting since the early 1980s has been Wheat. They export wheat to 207 countries. They started seeing varying exports of sales year on year for various countries. The reason that was theorized by them had a lot of natural causes like floods, country growth, population explosion etc.
Now they need to decide which countries fall in the same range of export and which don’t. They also need to know which countries export is low and can be improved and which countries are performing very well across the years. What they need is a repeatable solution which won’t get affected no matter how much data is added across time and that they should be able to explain the data across years in less number of variables.
